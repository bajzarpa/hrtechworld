*This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).*

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bajzarpa/hrtechworld.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bajzarpa/hrtechworld)

## Notes
I had to eject the create-react-app scripts, because i'm using a preprocessor and by default the create-react-app does not supports it.

### Commands
- To build: `{yarn|npm} run build` 
- To start: `{yarn|npm} start`
